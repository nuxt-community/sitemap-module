Hooks are listeners to Nuxt events. [Learn more](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-hooks)

You can register hooks on certain life cycle events.

| Hook  | Arguments  | When  | 
|---|---|---|
| sitemap:generate:before  | (nuxt, sitemapOptions)  | Hook on before site generation  |
| sitemap:generate:done  |  (nuxt) | Hook on sitemap generation finished |

Note: Above hooks only work with `nuxt generate`
